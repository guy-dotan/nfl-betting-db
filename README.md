# Building NFL Betting Database

## Final Project - UCLA Stats 405: Data Management (Spring 2018)


The final project for this course was to handle and process a large dataset that was not easily accessible. I decided to build a NFL betting odds database scraped from several archives of betting lines from various websites. 

For the summary of the project goal, methodology and results, please review the following file: [NFL Betting DB Summary.pdf](https://github.com/guy-dotan/ucla-mas405-final/blob/master/NFL%20Betting%20DB%20Summary.pdf).

The "R code" folder contains several different scripts that scrape data from the necessary websites to merge into a the final dataset. 

The "CSVs" folder contains the outputs of the data scraping as well as the final merged file "nfl_full.csv"
