# Building NFL Betting Database

## Final Project - UCLA Stats 405: Data Management (Spring 2018)


The final project for this course was to handle and process and large dataset that was not easily accessible. I decided to build a NFL betting odds database scraped from several archives of betting lines from various websites. 

For the summary of the project goal, methodology and results, please review the `NFL Betting DB Summary.pdf`.

The "R code" folder contains several different scripts that scrape data from different websites to merge into a the final dataset. 

The "CSVs" folder contains the outputs of the data scraping as well as the final merged file "nfl_full.csv"
